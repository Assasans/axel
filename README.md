# Axel â€” a private server for *KonoSuba: Fantastic Days*

</div>

### Current progress

The first scene ("And so the Adventure Begins!") works.
The home and profile menus barely work.

A lot of gacha banners (including collaborations ones) is visible, but still not all 947 of them.
Loot pool is hardcoded. **Gacha stories work** as they don't need to interact with the server.

All main quests are enabled.
Battles work but no rewards are actually given and you can't change your party.

Database support is being implemented, new account sequence works, you can change your name.
